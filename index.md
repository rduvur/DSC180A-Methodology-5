### Section: A02
### Mentor: Kyle Shannon

### Prompt 1:
The most interesting topic covered so far was getting insight on real life procedures used to catch spesis before complications. We got the opportunity to speak with a registered nurse @ UCSD Health, who helped us identift potential places where we could optimize the process.

### Prompt 2:
A possible place we could help is offering nurses who intake patients a quicker way to digest the available patient history in their electronic health record. We could use LLM tools and develop a front end to propose an extentsion to Epic's current software.

### Prompt 3:
One change we could have made is using a docker contair to work on our development. This would make it a smoother setup experience for end users. They wouldn't have to worry about versioning or conflicting libraries. 

### Prompt 4:
It could be interesting to use agentic workflows to generate a quality synopsis of patient EHRs. This could help prevent hallucinations which would be disastrous if they were to happen.
